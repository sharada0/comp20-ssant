<h1>Security Assessment of 2048 Game Center</h1>
<h3>By: Sharada Sant<br>
April 25, 2014</h3>

<h4>I. Introduction</h4>
<p>This assignment is a followup to the previous assignment, in which students 
made a 2048 Game Center application, which used a Mongo database to store final 
scores, usernames, and grids for the recent popular game 2048, created by 
Gabriele Cirulli. The goal of this assignment was to find security vulnerabilities 
in the Game Center of another student, Skyler Tom. For each vulnerability, 
documentation was sought for the issue, location, severity, and resolution.
</p>

<h4>II. Methodology</h4>
<p>"Black box" testing was the first method used, attempting to perform attacks 
without looking at any of the source code. The first security vulnerability described 
in this report was found in this manner. Following this, "white box" testing 
was done to search for vulnerabilities by looking at the code, and this revealed the 
second and third vulnerabilities described in this report.
</p>

<h4>III. Abstract of Findings</h4>
<p>There are several security vulnerabilities found in the Game Center app. The main 
reason behind most of the vulnerabilities is that the application does not properly 
check user input, and instead simply assumes that it will always be as expected. 
However, this leaves the door open for users with malicious intent to exploit this 
lack of validation by providing incorrect or unexpected input, which can unfortunately 
have serious consequences on the app's functionality. Fortunately, there are simple ways 
in which these types of issues can be resolved, to make a more secure application.
</p>

<h4>IV. Issues Found</h4>
<p>
1. Issue: No input validation for usernames<br><br>
Location: app.js<br>
Severity: High. This provides easy access to hackers to insert malicious code as 
use input, which could have consequences ranging from humorous to devastating, 
depending on how evil the hacker wants to be.<br>
Description: <br>
Fix: Add in code to check / validate the username input 
(i.e., alphanumeric, no special characters, less than 10 characters in length).<br>
<br>
2. Issue: The Mongo database is not protected<br><br>
Location: app.js<br>
Severity: Medium. <br>
Description: <br>
Anyone can insert or remove or otherwise alter data in the 
database simply by accessing Mongo from the terminal.<br>
Fix: Enable authentication for Mongo<br>
<br>
3. Issue: CORS - Universal Allow<br><br>
Location: app.js<br>
Severity: Medium. <br>
Description: <br>
Fix: Either add code to validate the response, or add in 
a method of authentication for XMLHttpRequest<br>
</p>

<h4>V. Conclusion</h4>
