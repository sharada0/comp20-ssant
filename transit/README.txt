A3 - MBTA map and schedule

1. Correctly Implemented:
----------------------
I think everything except the polyline has been correctly implemented. 
The polyline does show up, and in the correct color, but it connects 
the stations in the wrong order (so it crisscrosses), and the 
red line fork also has not been implemented.

Otherwise, the rest should be correctly implemented (map, schedule, 
station markers, etc.).

Note: I did all of the project in my public repo sharada0.github.io,
because that is how I could view the page by refreshing, in order
to debug. So all my commits were done there, in case you were not
seeing any in my private comp20 repo. I just wanted to explain this,
to make sure I don't lose any points for commiting regularly.

2. Collaboration / Discussion:
---------------------------
I briefly talked about some aspects with Shriya Nevatia, to clarify 
some questions about the assignment, and I also used the questions and 
answers on Piazza.

3. Time spent:
-----------
I think I spent about 6-8 hours on this assignment.
