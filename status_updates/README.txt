Lab 7 - Comp 20


The html file for this lab is profile.html
The profile0.html file can be ignored (it is just lab 5 unchanged).

I correctly stored messages in local storage, 
and messages are redisplayed on return to the page.

The format is the same as from lab 5, except that it does 
not print the items in the correct order (although all the
items are printed).

Something went wrong with the Node.js app I tried to make,
so that is not functional, unfortunately. Sorry!
