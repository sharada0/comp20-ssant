1. Correctly Implemented
------------------------
I believe I have correctly implemented all aspects of the assignment, and met all specifications.
I created all the graphics for the canvas using the sprite sheet.
Graphics include: the skies, dirt road, bushes, tree, dog, and five birds.


2. Collaboration
----------------
I did not collaborate with anyone, and this assignment is my own work.
I discussed the rules of the assignment in general terms with other students (e.g., Manvi Goyal).


3. Time Spent
-------------
I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
I used a token for this assignment.
